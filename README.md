# OpenVPNDocker
OpenVPN Docker container the ultra lazy way.

Theres a few scenarios I can cover before I start being lazy and don't want to share cool things any more.

## If you already have a server and know some things
If you're really lazy you can just copy the text from here:
```bash
wget -O launch_vpn.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chamunks/OpenVPNDocker/master/launch_vpn.sh
chmod +x launch_vpn.sh
./launch_vpn.sh
```
###OR if you have CURL installed
```bash
source <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chamunks/OpenVPNDocker/master/launch_vpn.sh)
```

The prerequisites for this to work is just you must install docker.  If you are lazy which if you're looking at this you very likely are.  You can install docker by following this guide. For the Operating System on your target server you'll use for your VPN.
